# Facial-keypoints

• Analyzed Kaggle’s facial key points dataset to locate 15 key feature points that help classify a person’s emotions to understand
why a model labels a certain emotion to a test image.
• Applied data augmentation by image inversions to generalize data. Created a ResNet architecture to remove vanishing gradient
problem. Achieved an improved accuracy of 85% compared to baseline CNN model.
